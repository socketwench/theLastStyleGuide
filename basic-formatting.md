# Basic Formatting

It's essential to use consistent formatting throughout your documentation. Formatting itself is another form of communication from you to your readers. By carefully choosing what formatting to use and when, you can make your docs easier to read and more useful for busy, stressed, and panicked users.

While modern documentation systems provide a huge diversity of formatting choices, relying on the following basics assures that they apply no matter the technology stack.

## Bold

Use **bold text** to identify key text on the screen. Readers can use this to know what to look for or what to click. The bold text stands out on the page, making it easy to focus on.

> When finished, click **Save**.

## Monospace

Use `monospace text` to specify items the user needs to type in. Monospace fonts make individual characters clear, so the user knows exactly what to type in.

> In the **Secret Key** field, enter: `qwerty123456`

## Italic text

Use _italic text_ to introduce a new term definition.

> Foobar is a _Content Management System_.

Less often, you can use it to emphasize a point or direction.

> Note that this _cannot_ be changed later.

## Acronyms

Introduce an acronym immediately after introducing the term for the first time.

> A _Platform as a Service_ (PaaS), provides a service-oriented foundation to create, distribute, and host new applications.

## Bullet points

Use bullet points when listing items where order does not matter.

> * Ice cream
> * Blueberry pie

## Numbered lists

Use numbered lists, sometimes called "ordinal lists", where the order of items is significant.

> 1. Do this step first.
> 2. Then this step second.
