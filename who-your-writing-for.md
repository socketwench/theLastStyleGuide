# Who you're writing for

Users are _not_ stupid. They are just as capable, skilled, and talented as you or any member of your team. They are as deserving of respect as the most seasoned developer or most nieve neophyte.

Never disrespect your users.

## Docs aren't the first thing users reach for

Rarely do users start by reading the documentation for a project. Most prefer to just start using it, and only seek out documentation when they are confused, lost, or stuck. A project's documentation is often the third or fourth thing a user will try. They will often ask a coworker, a friend, or perform a web search before ever reading the documentation.

Our job is to support them, even more than it is to inform them. If this sounds like squishy-emotional stuff, it is. Users are not machines, they feel.

## Users don't read docs, they skim for answers

When users finally do open documentation, they are often desperate for answers. They want to get un-stuck, but do not know how. As a result, we need to expect users will _not_ read documentation from top to bottom, but will start by skimming.

Your documentation needs to be skim-friendly, direct, and spartan. Large paragraphs of descriptions and theory will be easily missed, while bold text, bullet lists, and the occasional graphic will stand out.

## Docs don't exist in a vacuum

Even if the product your documenting is new, what you write will rarely be the only source of information on it. For end-user and open source applications, tutorials, podcasts, blog posts, videos, will all appear in time. For closed-source and enterprise applications, the marketing department and technical sales department will often create additional material to educate and guide users.

Come to expect this; what you write should describe and instruct, but never sell, never dive deep into minutae.
