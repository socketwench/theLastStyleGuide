# The Last Style Guide

The Last Style Guide is a brief, no-nonsense style guide for writing technical documentation that's maintainable, useful, and easy to write.

The rules in this guide were developed over the course of a decade. Initially, it was used to write lab instructions for software training projects. Later, it was adapted to a style guide used for project documentation with great success.

## About the title

I had initially rejected the title "The Last Style Guide" as too boisterous and presumptive. After several hours of trying and failing to find a better title I realized something: This would be the third time I've (re)written a documentation style guide. The first time was when when I codified my writing style into a series of repeatable rules for other education developers in my department to use. The second time was when writing documentation for a new web platform. When I found myself facing the same problem a third time in my career, I decided enough was enough. I wanted this to be the last time I would need to write this guide, and I wanted to make it publicly available for everyone to use.
